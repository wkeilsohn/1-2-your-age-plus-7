# 1/2 Your Age +7
A Cobol program to determine if an individual falls within the "1/2 your age +7" rule. This is a common, although a bit old fashion, rule often used in dating. The application takes user input related to the age of said user and determines what age range an individual needs to be in to fall within the guidlines of said rule. The program is also able to take input relating to the age of an existing partner and determine if the age range detween the two individuals falls within said rule. 

## Update 2025
I realized that the actual Cobol script was not uploaded to the repository. Thus, in late May 2025, I began rebuilding the application. The newly rebuilt application (and script) is included. 

If I ever figure out what happened to the old script, I'll include it in a seperate file. 

## Installation and Setup
This is a cobol script, so it may need to be compiled. If you need to compile the code, I used gnuCobol and MinGW on Windows. That said, OpenCobol on a Linux or IOS system should also work.

The executable file has been included, which may allow you to run it straight from the command line on a Windows machine. 

## Usage
Usage of this program can be leveraged to determine the age difference between two individuals.
It can also be used to determine the age range of potential partners for oneself. 

Finaly, as a joke, it can also be used to snark on a ton of reality shows running on TLC. 

## Support
Currently, no further updates are planned at this time.
