# 1/2 Your Age +7
A Cobol program to determine if an individual falls within the "1/2 your age +7" rule. This is a common, although a bit old fashion, rule often used in dating. The application takes user input related to the age of said user and determines what age range an individual needs to be in to fall within the guidlines of said rule. The program is also able to take input relating to the age of an existing partner and determine if the age range detween the two individuals falls within said rule. 

## Installation and Setup
This is a cobol script, so it will need to be compiled. For testing purposes, OpenCobol was used on a Linux Unbutu machine. Once compiled, it should be able to run from the comand line. 

## Usage
Usage of this program can be leveraged to determine the age difference between two individuals. It can also be used to dtermine the age range of potential partners. Finaly, it can also be used to snark a ton of reality shows running on TLC. 

## Support
